Function practice exercises from Colt Steele's web development bootcamp.

Exercise #1 
Created a function that accepts one argument, 'temp', and returns 'true' if the argument is greater than or equal to 75.
Returns 'false' if anything else. NOTE didn't have to use "else" because the first 'return' will stop the the rest of the function from executing.

Exercise #2
Created an if statement within the function so a length of 0 would return "null" instead of undefined. Once again, I didn't need to use "else" because 'return' stops the rest of function from executing anyway.

Exercise #3
The goal of this funcion is to return a new string with the first character capitalized.
