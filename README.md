Function practice exercises from Colt Steele's web development bootcamp.

Exercise #1 
Created a function that accepts one argument, 'temp', and returns 'true' if the argument is greater than or equal to 75.
Returns 'false' if anything else. NOTE didn't have to use "else" because the first 'return' will stop the the rest of the function from executing.
